# 🚀 CreTech Java Internship Projects

Welcome to my Java Internship portfolio repository!  
This repo documents the hands-on projects, source code, and learning progress during my internship at **CreTech**.

---

## 📌 Overview

Throughout the internship, I built several Java-based applications focusing on core programming concepts, clean architecture, and real-world functionality.  
Each project demonstrates:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java I/O and exception handling
- Modular code structure
- Problem-solving using Java
