Developed during my Java Internship at CreTech

"Learning by building. Growing by sharing."

Tips for further improvement:

Add project badges (build status, license, etc.) for extra polish.

Include screenshots or UML diagrams for each project to visually illustrate features or architecture.

Link each project name to its own subfolder or detailed README as you expand.
